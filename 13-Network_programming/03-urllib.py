# Exercise 3: Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the document from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, 
# and (3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. 
# Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.
